  <div class="cards-container">
    <p style="margin: 20px">
      <b>“Agile”</b> describes a way of working where self-organizing and
      cross-functional teams can develop evolving solutions which adapt to
      changing environments, requirements, and new learnings and ideas. The
      Agile methodology was formalized in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto. But a
      lot of the Agile concepts are not new! In fact, most of us have probably
      applied it in some way when doing high school science projects. Twelve
      principles based on the manifesto were created as a guideline to help
      development teams follow the agile methodology. These include customer
      satisfaction, changing requirements, frequent delivery, regular
      communication, supporting team members, face-to-face communication,
      measure work progress, development process, good design, measure progress,
      continue to seek results as well as reflecting and adapting frequently.
      So, why might we use Agile? As humans, we're used to sticking with rigid
      structures and linear steps. But in most projects or processes, things are
      likely to change in ways we didn't consider or know about when we first
      started. With agile methodology, we emphasize adaptability and incremental
      improvements to our solution. So, if our business is disrupted by external
      or internal factors, we're better able to respond. There exists different
      agile methodologies such as Scrum and DSDM.

<!-- Scrum Section -->
<section class="containerTop" style="border-bottom: 0.5px solid black">
  <h3 style="margin: 20px; font-size: 1.5rem">Scrum</h3>
  <div class="cards-container">
    <p style="margin: 20px">
      Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and
      organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex
      problems. In a Scrum team, there are 3 key roles which include the product
      owner who maximizes value from the product, the Scrum master who is a
      servant leader to the team and the developers who self-organize and
      collectively develop the software or product. To understand the Scrum
      methodology, it is important to understand the underlying theory, main
      artifacts, and events which create the Scrum methodology.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-size: 1.2em"><b>Theory</b></span>
      <br />
      <b>Incremental Delivery</b>: Scrum focuses on delivering value in small,
      frequent increments. This approach allows teams to provide tangible
      results to stakeholders at the end of each sprint, fostering a steady
      stream of progress.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Empiricism</b>: The decisions in Scrum are based on empirical evidence
      and experience. The team makes informed choices by observing and measuring
      their work and its outcomes. This data-driven approach encourages informed
      decision-making rather than relying solely on predictions.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Transparency</b>: Openness and visibility are vital in Scrum. The team,
      stakeholders, and other relevant parties share information about the work,
      progress, and challenges. This transparency fosters trust and
      collaboration among all involved.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Inspection</b>: Regularly examining the work, processes, and outcomes
      is a central aspect of Scrum. This inspection helps identify potential
      issues early on, allowing the team to make necessary adjustments and
      improvements.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Adaptation</b>: Scrum embraces change and encourages teams to adapt
      based on new information. If issues arise or circumstances change, the
      team can adjust their plans, processes, and goals to better address the
      situation.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-size: 1.2rem"
        ><b>3 main Artifacts</b> - to help manage work</span
      >
      <br />
      <b>Product Backlog</b>: This is an ordered list of all the desired
      features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other work items that provide value
      to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for maintaining and
      prioritizing this backlog based on input from stakeholders and the team.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Sprint Backlog</b>: For each sprint, the team selects a set of items
      from the Product Backlog that they commit to completing. The Sprint
      Backlog outlines the specific tasks and activities required to turn the
      selected backlog items into a shippable product increment.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Increment</b>: At the end of each sprint, the team delivers a
      potentially shippable product version. This increment includes all the
      work completed during the sprint, adhering to the Definition of Done
      (DoD). The increment is a tangible result that adds value to the product
      and could potentially be released to users.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-size: 1.2rem"><b>5 main Events</b></span>
      <br />
      <b>Sprint Planning</b>: At the start of each sprint, the team holds a
      Sprint Planning meeting to determine which backlog items they will work on
      during the sprint. The team also defines the goals and objectives for the
      sprint.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>The Sprint</b>: Contains all of the other events and timeboxed to a
      maximum of 4 weeks. The aim of the sprint is to deliver a completed,
      usable increment which meets the sprint goal.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Daily Scrum</b>: Also known as the daily stand-up, this is a short
      daily meeting where the team members synchronize their work. They discuss
      progress, challenges, and plans for the day. It's an opportunity to foster
      communication and collaboration.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Sprint Review</b>: At the end of each sprint, the team demonstrates the
      work they've completed to stakeholders. Feedback is collected, and the
      Product Backlog is adjusted based on this input. The team also reflects on
      their performance.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Sprint Retrospective</b>: This event occurs after the Sprint Review and
      focuses on the team's process. The team discusses what went well, what
      could be improved, and formulates action items for refining their
      processes in the next sprint.

  <div class="cards-container">
    <p style="margin: 20px">
      <span style="font-size: 1.4rem"><b>What is DSDM?</b></span>
      <br />
      Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM) is an agile project method that
      focuses on the overall project lifecycle. We can use it to help produce
      quick and efficient results for the organization. DSDM has 8 principles:
      focus on the business needs, develop iteratively, demonstrate control,
      deliver on time, build incrementally from firm foundations, communicate
      continuously and clearly, collaborate and never compromise quality.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-size: 1.2em"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span>
      <br />
      There are various roles and responsibilities within the DSDM framework.
      Every role is an important player in DSDM. We only discuss the key project
      level and Solution Development Team (SDT) roles here.
      <br />
      <br />
      Business sponsor: senior project level role (AKA the project champion), is
      responsible for the business case and project budget/finance.
      <br />
      <br />
      Business visionary: provides a clear vision, communicates business
      sponsor's needs, and ensures these are represented within the business
      case. Also makes sure the solution adds value to the overall business.
      <br />
      <br />
      Business ambassador: responsible for daily communication between the
      project and the business. They are the key business representative within
      the Solution Development Team (SDT).
      <br />
      <br />
      Project manager: co-ordinates high level management aspects of the
      project, focuses on managing the working environment for the evolving
      solution.
      <br />
      <br />
      Technical coordinator: responsible for authority of the project, ensures
      project is technically coherent and meets agreed standards as well as
      provides the technical vision.
      <br />
      <br />
      Team leader: leads the SDT, ensuring the team works together efficiently
      to fulfill stated objectives. Also involved in planning and coordination
      of product delivery.
      <br />
      <br />
      Solution developer: comprehends the business requirements and converts
      them into a deployable solution.
      <br />
      <br />
      Solution tester: conducts testing in compliance with the agreed strategy.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-size: 1.2em"><b>DSDM Process</b></span>
      <br />
      The DSDM process is used to create the project lifecycle. DSDM provides an
      iterative and incremental approach to development and delivery. We
      primarily focus on the most vital business needs, with less crucial
      features being delivered later. This approach allows business
      representatives to view the solution as it evolves, provide regular
      feedback, and request changes throughout the solution development process.
      There are two types of products which are evolutionary and milestone
      products. There are various products including the feasibility assessment,
      business case, and the prioritized requirement list.

<!-- Requirements Gathering Section -->
<section class="containerTop" style="border-bottom: 0.5px solid black">
  <h3 style="margin: 20px; font-size: 1.5rem">Requirements Gathering</h3>
  <div class="cards-container">
    <p style="margin: 20px">
      Requirements refer to the detailed descriptions of the capabilities,
      features, functionalities, and qualities that a business solution must
      possess to meet the needs and goals of the stakeholders. These are usually
      gathered by a business analyst who must consider the requirements of many
      business areas.
      <br />
      <br />
      Business requirements represent the high-level needs and objectives of the
      organization, describing the larger goals, problems, or opportunities that
      drive the need for a solution. Stakeholder requirements capture the needs,
      expectations, and preferences of various stakeholders who will interact
      with or be affected by the solution. This includes customers, users, local
      communities, and regulatory bodies.
      <br />
      <br />
      After gathering all of the requirements, requirements can be broken down
      into either functional or non-functional requirements. Functional
      requirements are requirements which detail what the system should do
      whereas non-functional requirements detail how the system executes a
      specific function. For our project, we categorized our requirements into
      functional and non-functional requirements as shown in the image to the
      right.

      Dynamic System Development Method (<b>DSDM</b>) is an agile project method
      that focuses on the overall project lifecycle. We can use it to help
      produce quick and efficient results for the organization. One of
      <b>DSDM</b> practices is MoSCoW.
      <br />

  <p style="margin: 20px">
    To demonstrate how MoSCoW is used, we used MoSCoW for this project! Please
    refer to the image in the top right for our MoSCoW prioritization. Firstly,
    we discussed and recorded the requirements for the project. We then collated
    and inserted all of the requirements into an online tool called 'ClickUp',
    in which we then collectively discussed each requirement and its level of
    prioritization of being either a must-have, should-have, could-have, or
    won't have at present.
    <br />
    <br />
    Upon successfully allocating each requirement's priority level, we then
    started working on the 'must-have' requirements column, with specific
    requirements being assigned to each team member(s). After each increment, we
    as a team reviewed the requirements once again, re-adjusting priority levels
    where necessary.

    <p style="margin: 20px">
      <span style="font-size: 1.2em"><b>Kanban Boards</b></span>
      <br />
      Progress tracking is essential to work more agilely. This guide will
      explore Kanban Boards' methods for monitoring progress in an agile
      environment. Derived from the Toyota Production System, Kanban boards are
      a versatile tool for monitoring progress in agile settings. Following
      these steps:
      <br />
      <br />
      Visualize Workflow: Create columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," "In
      Test," and "Done."
      <br />
      <br />
      Limit Work in Progress: Focus on tasks you can manage effectively at any
      given time.
      <br />
      <br />
      Manage Flow: Ensure that work items move through the system without
      blockages.
      <br />
      <br />
      Measure and Iterate: Continuously assess the flow, making incremental
      improvements.
      <br />
      <br />
      Explicit Process Policies: Define and communicate how tasks are handled.
      <br />
      <br />
      Improve Collaboratively: Foster a team-wide commitment to improvement.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-size: 1.2em"
        ><b>Kanban Principles and Practices</b>:</span
      >
      <br />
      Principles: Start with What You Do Now: Map existing tasks onto the Kanban
      board. Incremental, Evolutionary Change: Implement small changes over time
      and monitor their effects. Respect the Current Process: Acknowledge
      existing processes, roles, and titles. Evolve them gradually. Encourage
      Acts of Leadership: Every team member can display leadership.
      <br />
      <br />
      Practices: Visualize Workflow: Populate the Kanban board with tasks to
      visually represent your workflow. Limit Work in Progress: Focus on
      completing tasks before moving to new ones to minimize distractions.
      Manage Flow: Ensure a steady flow of tasks through the system, making
      adjustments as needed. Make Process Policies Explicit: Clearly define how
      tasks are approached and maintain visibility. Improve Collaboratively:
      Enhance processes collectively to maximize the team's efficiency and
      effectiveness.
      <br />
      <br />
      Kanban Boards offer insightful methods to gauge progress in agile
      environments and facilitate continuous workflow visualization and
      improvement. Incorporate these tools to elevate your agile practices and
      keep your projects on track.
      <br />

      <br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-size: 1.2em"><b>Project planning</b></span>
      <br />
      To track our project progress effectively, we employed a Kanban board.
      This visual management tool allowed us to monitor the status of each task
      throughout the project lifecycle. The board was divided into columns
      representing different stages of work, such as "To Do," "In Progress," "In
      Review," and "Done." Team members could easily move tasks between columns
      as they progressed. Limiting work in progress helped maintain focus and
      ensured that tasks were completed before new ones were started. Regular
      reviews and retrospectives allowed us to adapt and improve our workflow
      continuously.
